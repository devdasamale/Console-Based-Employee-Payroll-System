# Console-Based-Employee-Payroll-System

The **Console-Based Employee Payroll System** is a Java application using Object-Oriented Programming principles to manage payroll information for both full-time and part-time employees. Designed for simplicity, this system offers essential payroll functionalities through a console interface.

### Key Features:
1. **Employee Types**: Supports full-time and part-time employees, with different salary calculation methods. Full-time employees have a fixed monthly salary, while part-time employeesâ€™ salaries depend on hours worked and hourly rate.
2. **Add/Remove Employees**: Allows administrators to add and remove employees by entering relevant details, ensuring the employee list stays up to date.
3. **View Payroll Information**: Displays all employees' payroll data, including name, ID, salary, and employee type.
4. **Admin Authentication and OTP Login**: Access is restricted through an admin username/password and an OTP (One-Time Password), adding a layer of security to the system.
5. **User-Friendly Console Interface**: With straightforward menu-driven options, administrators can easily navigate through payroll functions.

This project serves as a practical, console-based tool for small organizations to manage and view employee payroll details effectively.
